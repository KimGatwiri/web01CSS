## 2. History and Development of CSS

### Early Web Design (Before CSS)
- In the early 1990s, web pages relied on HTML for styling, using `<font>`, `<b>`, and `<center>`, making code messy and hard to maintain.
- Developers lacked a flexible way to separate structure (HTML) from design.

### The Birth of CSS (1996)
- Håkon Wium Lie (co-creator of CSS) proposed the first version (CSS1) in 1996.
- CSS1 introduced basic styles like fonts, colors, and text alignment.

### CSS2 and CSS2.1 (1998-2011)
- CSS2 (1998): Introduced positioning, media types, and table layouts.
- CSS2.1 (2011): Fixed inconsistencies, improved browser support.

### The Modern Era: CSS3 (2011-Present)
- Introduced modular development, making CSS more flexible.
- Added features like animations, gradients, flexbox, grid, and media queries.
- Continuous updates with CSS4 concepts (though CSS4 is not an official version).
